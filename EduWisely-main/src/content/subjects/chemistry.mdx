# Chemistry

Chemistry is the scientific discipline concerned with the study of the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of matter. It explores the fundamental constituents of matter and their combinations and interactions, bridging the gap between the physical sciences and life sciences. Chemistry is often referred to as the central science due to its pivotal role in connecting other scientific disciplines.
