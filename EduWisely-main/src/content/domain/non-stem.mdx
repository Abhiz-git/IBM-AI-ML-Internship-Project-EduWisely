# Overview of Non-STEM Fields

Non-STEM fields, often referred to as liberal arts or humanities, encompass a wide range of disciplines outside the traditional Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics categories. These fields focus on humanistic, social, and artistic endeavors, offering a comprehensive understanding of culture, society, and human behavior. Non-STEM education is crucial for developing critical thinking, communication, and interpersonal skills, preparing students for a variety of careers and roles that are essential for a well-rounded society.
